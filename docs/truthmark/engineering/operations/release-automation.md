# Release Automation

## Purpose

This doc owns current release and CI automation behavior.

## Scope

It covers GitHub workflow triggers, verification steps, and generated GitHub Action template behavior.

## Current Implementation Behavior

Release, CI, and GitHub Pages deployment behavior is implemented through checked-in GitHub workflow files and the GitHub Action template renderer.

The npm publish workflow runs from `release/**` tag push events, with manual `workflow_dispatch` as an operator fallback. Tag-triggered publishing keeps the GitHub Actions OIDC signing certificate tied to a concrete `refs/tags/...` source ref for npm provenance verification.

The GitHub Pages workflow deploys the committed static introduction site from `site/**` after pushes to `main` that change the site or Pages workflow.

## Operational Surface

- GitHub Actions workflows under `.github/workflows/**`
- static introduction site files under `site/**`
- GitHub Action template rendering in `src/templates/github-action.ts`

## Runtime Topology

Automation runs in GitHub Actions. There is no Truthmark daemon or persistent runtime service.

## Configuration

- GitHub workflow YAML files define CI, release, and Pages deployment triggers.
- `src/templates/github-action.ts` owns generated GitHub Action template behavior.

## Permissions

Permissions are owned by the checked-in GitHub workflow and action template definitions.

This doc does not add permissions beyond those source files.

## Deployment And Rollback

- Workflow changes deploy when repository workflow files are committed to the target branch.
- Static introduction site changes deploy through GitHub Pages after they merge to `main`.
- Rollback is a normal Git revert or follow-up workflow-file change.

## Availability And Observability

- GitHub Actions provides run status and logs.
- Truthmark has no separate release automation runtime to monitor.

## Product Truth Links

- None.

## Engineering Decisions

- Decision (2026-06-14): Release automation truth is engineering/operational truth because it describes current repository mechanics.
- Decision (2026-06-26): GitHub Pages deploys only the committed static introduction site under `site/**`.
  - The site is a presentation artifact; Markdown truth docs remain canonical.

## Rationale

Release automation is documented as operations truth because failures, permissions, and rollback are repository mechanics rather than product capability promises.

## Non-Goals

- This doc does not define package versioning policy.
- This doc does not own npm publishing credentials or external registry behavior.

## Maintenance Notes

Update when CI triggers, release prerequisites, publish steps, Pages deployment steps, or action templates change.
