# Truthmark Realize

Use this skill only when the user explicitly asks to realize truth docs into code.

Use as a Gemini CLI Agent Skill; commands remain available under `/truthmark:*` for command-first invocation.

Invocations: OpenCode /skill truthmark-realize; Codex /truthmark-realize or $truthmark-realize; Claude Code /truthmark-realize; GitHub Copilot /truthmark-realize; Gemini CLI /truthmark:realize.

Quick procedure:
- Follow repository instruction files that exist in this checkout; do not assume any optional policy path exists.
- Read the source truth docs, inspect .truthmark/config.yml and configured route files (docs/truthmark/routes/areas.md; docs/truthmark/routes/areas/) only when they exist, then inspect tests and relevant functional code directly.
- Truth docs lead; code follows.
- may write functional code only; must not edit truth docs or truth routing while realizing those docs.
- Read support/procedure.md before changing code.
- Read support/report-template.md before the final report.

Progressive disclosure:
- support/procedure.md — read before edits or detailed auditing; contains core review questions
- support/report-template.md — read before the final report
