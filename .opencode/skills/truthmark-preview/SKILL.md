# Truthmark Preview

Use this skill only when the user explicitly asks to preview Truthmark routing or workflow choice before edits.

Invocations: OpenCode /skill truthmark-preview; Codex /truthmark-preview or $truthmark-preview; Claude Code /truthmark-preview; GitHub Copilot /truthmark-preview; Gemini CLI /truthmark:preview.

## Live workflow preflight

When the local Truthmark CLI is available, run the live workflow contract before acting:

```bash
truthmark workflow status --workflow truthmark-preview --json
truthmark workflow instructions --workflow truthmark-preview --json
```

If a caller supplies a comparison ref, preserve it with `--base <ref>` on both commands; do not invent a default branch.

Before writes, parse the JSON command envelopes:

- stop when `data.workflowState.applicability.state` is `blocked`, `not_applicable`, or `ambiguous`; current-scope continuation is read-only reporting of `nextSteps` or diagnostics
- obey `data.workflowState.actionContext.allowedWritePaths`, `forbiddenWritePaths`, and stop conditions
- run structured helpers from `data.instructions.helperValidationCommands` when present and report each helper as passed, failed, or skipped with reason
- shape the final report from `data.instructions.reportTemplate.sections` or `finalReportShape`; use checked-in report templates only when live instructions are unavailable
- continue direct checkout inspection for code, docs, routes, tests, and evidence; CLI output is guardrails, not proof by itself

If the workflow CLI is unavailable or too old, continue direct checkout inspection and checked-in support files without broadening writes. Include `workflow status/instructions: skipped` and the skip reason in the final report.

Quick procedure:
- Follow repository instruction files that exist in this checkout; do not assume any optional policy path exists.
- Inspect .truthmark/config.yml and configured route files (docs/truthmark/routes/areas.md; docs/truthmark/routes/areas/) only when they exist; then inspect only the truth docs or implementation files needed to preview ownership.
- Truth Preview is read-only; this report is intended, not authorized.
- must not edit files and must not issue write leases; do not run Truth Sync automatically, replace Truth Check, claim final correctness, or mutate code.
- Use optional read-only route-auditor evidence only when it reduces context or clarifies ownership.
- Hand off to the selected workflow after user approval.
